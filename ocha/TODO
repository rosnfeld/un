Create a demo FTS report D from this data
  - should be pretty small modification to report C code

Start to look at what a first draft generic CSV format would be for CKAN

Ask CJ if splitting out carry-over is of interest

Do some data validation
 - make sure there are country entries for all appeals (you already found one case where this was missing!)

Abstract data source for pandas objects
- JSON from web
- JSON from file
- pickle
- etc


DONE

Rename your main file to fts_queries.py or something similar

Add a pip requirements file

Figure out if contributions handle "carry over"
  - yes, you can look at the "donor" named "Carry-over (donors not specified)"

Create a demo FTS report C from this data
