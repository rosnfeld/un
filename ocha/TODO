Create a demo FTS report C or D from this data

Start to look at what a first draft generic CSV format would be for CKAN

Abstract data source for pandas objects
- JSON from web
- JSON from file
- pickle
- etc

Add a pip requirements file

Do some data validation
 - make sure there are country entries for all appeals (you already found one case where this was missing!)


DONE

Rename your main file to fts_queries.py or something similar
