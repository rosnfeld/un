Start to look at what a first draft generic CSV format would be for CKAN
- based more on CHD or existing FTS reports?

Re-organize scripts
 - create a fts subdirectory, move everything there?
 - shorten script names given the amount of redundancy/repetition?

Document column descriptions for each dataframe that can be returned by queries

Perhaps unify appeal vs emergency handling in script args by making users pass in kwargs?
  - appeal_id=1234 vs emergency_id=9876, or similar, then build URL based on what kwarg was used

Centralize string constants in one place
 - fts_strings.py?

Ask CJ if splitting out carry-over is of interest

Make some sort of entity relationship diagram to help document FTS data? It seems something roughly like:
- countries can have emergencies, which can have appeals, which have projects (categorized into clusters)
 - an emergency _can_ have an appeal but does not have to
    - if an emergency is bad enough, they make an appeal, but often doesn't happen
- contributions can be made to emergencies and if applicable tagged to a specific appeal
- funding can be allocated to projects, which are carried out by organizations

Ask FTS they handle duplicates
- contributions 201359 and 201360 (for appeal 994) look suspiciously similar to me

Abstract data source for pandas objects
- JSON from web
- JSON from file
- pickle
- etc


DONE

Rename your main file to fts_queries.py or something similar

Add a pip requirements file

Figure out if contributions handle "carry over"
  - yes, you can look at the "donor" named "Carry-over (donors not specified)"

Create a demo FTS report C from this data

Create a demo FTS report D from this data

Do some data validation
 - make sure there are country entries for all appeals (you already found one case where this was missing!)

Figure out CERF/CHF/ERF funding
- perhaps appeal 1009 / emergency 15451, highlighted by your data validation, are relevant?
  - yes, these seem to house CERF data
    - you need to look at raw contributions, not funding, to find answers though..?
- CHFs and ERFs are related to countries
  - do they possibly show up in contributions as donors? yes! so does CERF
  - so we can see money flowing from these pools, though maybe not always to these pools?
- next step is to try and address CHD items using this new discovery
  - look at CERF funding by cluster for a given appeal (FY240-FY350)
  - look at ERF funding by cluster for a given appeal (FY390-FY490)
    - looks like CHD is missing an item for "Safety and Security of Staff and Operations"
  - FY380 ERF: Emergency Response Fund contributions by donor (Total)
    - this says "Appeal", but I don't think current donations are attached to an appeal for a lot of the ERF countries
      - Ethiopia is a good example here, it has a current Emergency but no current Appeal
    - so let's do this by emergency id, not appeal id
- ok, looks like I have the basics of this down, I can replicate most numbers (all I've tried on Pooled Fund reports
