Come up with CSVs that capture all available from the FTS API
  - These will be more or less raw copies from the JSON, and while not super-interesting they seem useful to have:
    - Sectors.csv
    - Countries.csv
    - Organizations.csv
  - These can be per country (I could also see per-year, or per-country-year):
    - Emergency.csv
    - Appeal.csv
    - Projects.csv (for all appeals for a given country)
    - Contributions.csv
  - These seem duplicative given other data and probably are not required:
    - Cluster (same data is in Projects)
    - Funding/Pledges (same data is in Contributions)

Document column descriptions for each dataframe that can be returned by queries

Perhaps unify appeal vs emergency handling in script args by making users pass in kwargs?
  - appeal_id=1234 vs emergency_id=9876, or similar, then build URL based on what kwarg was used
