It might be nice to have a master list of countries and years
 - in the meantime, use the union of all countries and years in the dataset
 - of course, some countries (e.g. SSD) don't exist in all years
 - and some datasets don't have all years
 - so how would we structure this..?
   - countries have a start and possibly end year
   - datasets have start and possibly end year
     - doesn't handle gaps, which might be legitimate
     - some datasets may only be captured every few years
   - if country and dataset should be present in a given year, make sure the data is there
