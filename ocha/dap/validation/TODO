Continue analyzing unusual year-over-year changes in a dataset

Report on "gap years" in the middle of a dataset for a given country

Look at dataset correlations
 - upper bound to make sure datasets aren't copies of each other
 - lower bounds to make sure that datasets that are supposed to be related are in fact similar
 - can't specify same way as before, as pairwise combinations are numerous

Nice metadata to have:
- better units for each indicator
- better "frequency" for each indicator (quarterly, annual, every 5 years, etc)

It might be nice to have a master list of countries and years
 - in the meantime, use the union of all countries and years in the dataset
 - of course, some countries (e.g. SSD) don't exist in all years
 - and some datasets don't have all years
 - so how would we structure this..?
   - countries have a start and possibly end year
   - datasets have start and possibly end year
     - doesn't handle gaps, which might be legitimate
     - some datasets may only be captured every few years
   - if country and dataset should be present in a given year, make sure the data is there
